= Using the GemFire Snapshot Service

Spring Data GemFire supports `Cache` and `Region` snapshots using http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/latest/managing/cache_snapshots/chapter_overview.html[GemFire's Snapshot Service].
The out-of-the-box Snapshot Service support offers several convenient features to simply the use of GemFire's http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/CacheSnapshotService.html[Cache]
and http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/RegionSnapshotService.html[Region] Snapshot Service APIs.

As http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/latest/managing/cache_snapshots/chapter_overview.html[GemFire documentation] describes,
snapshots allow you to save and subsequently reload the data later, which can be useful for moving data between environments,
say from production to a staging or test environment in order to reproduce data-related issues in a controlled context.
You can imagine combining Spring Data GemFire's Snapshot Service support with http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-definition-profiles[Spring's bean definition profiles]
to load snapshot data specific to the environment as necessary.

Spring Data GemFire's support for GemFire's Snapshot Service begins with the `<gfe-data:snapshot-service>` element
from the GFE Data Access Namespace.  For example, I might define Cache-wide snapshots to be loaded as well as saved
with a couple snapshot imports and a single data export definition as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe-data:snapshot-service id="gemfireCacheSnapshotService">
  <gfe-data:snapshot-import location="/absolute/filesystem/path/to/import/fileOne.snapshot"/>
  <gfe-data:snapshot-import location="relative/filesystem/path/to/import/fileTwo.snapshot"/>
  <gfe-data:snapshot-export
      location="/absolute/or/relative/filesystem/path/to/export/directory"/>
</gfe-data:snapshot-service>
----

You can define as many imports and/or exports as you like.  You can define just imports or just exports. The file locations
and directory paths can be absolute, or relative to the Spring Data GemFire application JVM process's working directory.

This is a pretty simple example and the snapshot service defined in this case refers to the GemFire `Cache`, having a
default name of `gemfireCache` (as described in <<bootstrap:cache>>).  If you name your cache bean definition something
different, than you can use the `cache-ref` attribute to refer to the cache bean by name:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache id="myCache"/>
...
<gfe-data:snapshot-service id="mySnapshotService" cache-ref="myCache">
...
</gfe-data:snapshot-service>
----

It is also straightforward to define a snapshot service for a GemFire Region by specifying the `region-ref` attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="Example" persistent="false" .../>
...
<gfe-data:snapshot-service id="gemfireCacheRegionSnapshotService" region-ref="Example">
  <gfe-data:snapshot-import location="relative/path/to/import/example.snapshot/>
  <gfe-data:snapshot-export location="/path/to/export/example.snapshot/>
</gfe-data:snapshot-service>
----

When the `region-ref` attribute is specified the Spring Data GemFire `SnapshotServiceFactoryBean` resolves
the `region-ref` attribute to a Region bean defined in the Spring context and then proceeds to create a
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/RegionSnapshotService.html[RegionSnapshotService].
Again, the snapshot import and export definitions function the same way, however, the `location` must refer to a file
on export.

NOTE: GemFire is strict about imported snapshot files actually existing before they are referenced.  For exports,
GemFire will create the snapshot file if it does not already exist.  If the snapshot file for export already exists,
the data will be overwritten.

NOTE: Spring Data GemFire includes a `suppress-import-on-init` attribute to the `<gfe-data:snapshot-service>` element
to suppress the configured snapshot service from trying to import data into the Cache or a Region on initialization.
This is useful when data exported from 1 Region is used to feed the import of another Region, for example.

[[bootstrap:snapshot:location]]
== Snapshot Location

For a `Cache`-based SnapshotService (i.e. a GemFire http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/CacheSnapshotService.html[CacheSnapshotService])
a developer would typically pass it a directory containing all the snapshot files to load rather than individual snapshot files,
as the overloaded http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/CacheSnapshotService.html#load(java.io.File,%20com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.snapshot.SnapshotOptions.SnapshotFormat)[load] method
in the `CacheSnapshotService` API indicates.

NOTE: Of course, a developer may use the other, overloaded `load(:File[], :SnapshotFormat, :SnapshotOptions)` method
variant to get specific about which snapshot files are to be loaded into the GemFire `Cache`.

However, Spring Data GemFire recognizes that a typical developer workflow might be to extract and export data from one environment
into several snapshot files, zip all of them up, and then conveniently move the ZIP file to another environment for import.

As such, Spring Data GemFire enables the developer to specify a JAR or ZIP file on import for a `Cache`-based SnapshotService
as follows:

[source,xml]
----
  <gfe-data:snapshot-service id="cacheBasedSnapshotService" cache-ref="gemfireCache">
    <gfe-data:snapshot-import location="/path/to/snapshots.zip"/>
  </gfe-data:snapshot-service>
----

Spring Data GemFire will conveniently extract the provided ZIP file and treat it like a directory import (load).

[[bootstrap:snapshot:filters]]
== Snapshot Filters

The real power of defining multiple snapshot imports and exports is realized through the use of snapshot filters.
Snapshot filters implement GemFire's http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/SnapshotFilter.html[SnapshotFilter] interface
and are used to filter Region entries for inclusion into the Region on import and for inclusion into the snapshot on export.

Spring Data GemFire makes it brain dead simple to utilize snapshot filters on import and export using the `filter-ref`
attribute or an anonymous, nested bean definition:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache/>

<gfe:partitioned-region id="Admins" persistent="false"/>
<gfe:partitioned-region id="Guests" persistent="false"/>

<bean id="activeUsersFilter" class="org.example.app.gemfire.snapshot.filter.ActiveUsersFilter/>

<gfe-data:snapshot-service id="adminsSnapshotService" region-ref="Admins">
  <gfe-data:snapshot-import location="/path/to/import/users.snapshot">
    <bean class="org.example.app.gemfire.snapshot.filter.AdminsFilter/>
  </gfe-data:snapshot-import>
  <gfe-data:snapshot-export location="/path/to/export/active/admins.snapshot"
                            filter-ref="activeUsersFilter"/>
</gfe-data:snapshot-service>

<gfe-data:snapshot-service id="guestsSnapshotService" region-ref="Guests">
  <gfe-data:snapshot-import location="/path/to/import/users.snapshot">
    <bean class="org.example.app.gemfire.snapshot.filter.GuestsFilter/>
  </gfe-data:snapshot-import>
  <gfe-data:snapshot-export location="/path/to/export/active/guests.snapshot"
                            filter-ref="activeUsersFilter"/>
</gfe-data:snapshot-service>
----

In addition, more complex snapshot filters can be expressed with the `ComposableSnapshotFilter` Spring Data GemFire class.
This class implements GemFire's http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/snapshot/SnapshotFilter.html[SnapshotFilter] interface
as well as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern[Composite] software design pattern.  In a nutshell, the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern[Composite] design pattern allows developers to compose multiple objects
of the same type and treat the conglomerate as single instance of the object type, a very powerful and useful abstraction
to be sure.

The `ComposableSnapshotFilter` has two factory methods, `'and'` and `'or'`, allowing developers to logically combine individual
snapshot filters using the AND and OR logical operators, respectively.  The factory methods just take a list of snapshot filters.

One is only limited by his/her imagination to leverage this powerful construct, for instance:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="activeUsersSinceFilter" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.snapshot.filter.ComposableSnapshotFilter"
      factory-method="and">
  <constructor-arg index="0">
    <list>
      <bean class="org.example.app.gemfire.snapshot.filter.ActiveUsersFilter"/>
      <bean class="org.example.app.gemfire.snapshot.filter.UsersSinceFilter"
            p:since="2015-01-01"/>
    </list>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>
----

You could then go onto combine the `activesUsersSinceFilter` with another filter using `'or'` like so:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="covertOrActiveUsersSinceFilter" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.snapshot.filter.ComposableSnapshotFilter"
      factory-method="or">
  <constructor-arg index="0">
    <list>
      <ref bean="activeUsersSinceFilter"/>
      <bean class="org.example.app.gemfire.snapshot.filter.CovertUsersFilter"/>
    </list>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>
----

[[bootstrap::snapshot::events]]
== Snapshot Events

By default, Spring Data GemFire uses GemFire's Snapshot Services on startup to import data and shutdown to export data.
However, you may want to trigger periodic, event-based snapshots, for either import or export from within your application.

For this purpose, Spring Data GemFire defines two additional Spring application events (extending Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationEvent.html[ApplicationEvent] class)
for imports and exports, respectively: `ImportSnapshotApplicationEvent` and `ExportSnapshotApplicationEvent`.

The two application events can be targeted at the entire GemFire Cache, or individual GemFire Regions.  The constructors
of these `ApplicationEvent` classes accept an optional Region pathname (e.g. "/Example") as well as 0 or more
`SnapshotMetadata` instances.

The array of `SnapshotMetadata` is used to override the snapshot meta-data defined by `<gfe-data:snapshot-import>`
and `<gfe-data:snapshot-export>` sub-elements in XML, which will be used in cases where snapshot application events
do not explicitly provide `SnapshotMetadata`.  Each individual `SnapshotMetadata` instance can define it's own `location`
and `filters` properties.

Import/export snapshot application events are received by all snapshot service beans defined in the Spring application context.
However, import/export events are only processed by "matching" snapshot service beans.

A Region-based `[Import|Export]SnapshotApplicationEvent` matches if the snapshot service bean defined is a `RegionSnapshotService`
and it's Region reference (as determined by `region-ref`) matches the Region's pathname specified by the snapshot application event.
A Cache-based `[Import|Export]SnapshotApplicationEvent` (i.e. a snapshot application event without a Region pathname) triggers
all snapshot service beans, including any `RegionSnapshotService` beans, to perform either an import or export, respectively.

It is very easy to use Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationEventPublisher.html[ApplicationEventPublisher] interface
to fire import and/or export snapshot application events from your application like so:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class ExampleApplicationComponent {

  @Autowired
  private ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

  @Resource(name = "Example")
  private Region<?, ?> example;

  public void someMethod() {
    ...

    SnapshotFilter myFilter = ...;

    SnapshotMetadata exportSnapshotMetadata = new SnapshotMetadata(new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"),
      "/path/to/export/data.snapshot"), myFilter, null);

    eventPublisher.publishEvent(new ExportSnapshotApplicationEvent(this, example.getFullPath(), exportSnapshotMetadata);

    ...
  }
}
----

In this particular example, only the "/Example" Region's SnapshotService bean will pick up and handle the export event,
saving the filtered "/Example" Region's data to the "data.snapshot" file in a sub-direcrtory of the application's
working directory.

Using Spring application events and messaging subsystem is a good way to keep your application loosely coupled.  It is
also not difficult to imagine that the snapshot application events could be fired on a periodic basis using Spring's
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#scheduling-task-scheduler[Scheduling] services.
