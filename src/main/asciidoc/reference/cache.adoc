[[bootstrap:cache]]
= Configuring a GemFire Cache

To use GemFire, a developer needs to either create a new `Cache` or connect to an existing one.  With the current
version of GemFire, there can be only one open Cache per VM (technically, per `ClassLoader`).  In most cases, the
`Cache` should only be created once.

NOTE: This section describes the creation and configuration of a cache member, appropriate in peer-to-peer topologies
and cache servers. A cache member is also commonly used for standalone applications, integration tests and proof of
concepts. In typical production systems, most application processes will act as cache clients, creating a `ClientCache`
instance instead. This is described in the sections <<bootstrap:cache:client>> and <<bootstrap:region:client>>.

A cache with default configuration can be created with a very simple declaration:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache/>
----

During Spring container initialization, any application context containing this cache definition will register
a `CacheFactoryBean` that creates a Spring bean named `gemfireCache` referencing a GemFire `Cache` instance.
This bean will refer to either an existing cache, or if one does not already exist, a newly created one.  Since no
additional properties were specified, a newly created cache will apply the default cache configuration.

All _Spring Data GemFire_ components that depend on the cache respect this naming convention, so there is no need
to explicitly declare the cache dependency.  If you prefer, you can make the dependency explicit via the `cache-ref`
attribute provided by various SDG namespace elements.  Also, you can easily override the cache's bean name using
the `id` attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache id="my-cache"/>
----

Starting with _Spring Data GemFire_ v1.2.0, a GemFire `Cache` can be fully configured using Spring.  However, GemFire's
native XML configuration file, `cache.xml`, is also supported.  For situations in which the GemFire cache needs to be
configured natively, simply provide a reference to the GemFire XML configuration file using the `cache-xml-location`
attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache id="cache-using-native-xml" cache-xml-location="classpath:cache.xml"/>
----

In this example, if the cache needs to be created, it will use the file named `cache.xml` located in the classpath root
to configure it.

NOTE: The configuration makes use of Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#resources[`Resource`]
abstraction to locate the file.  This allows various search patterns to be used, depending on the runtime environment
or the prefix specified (if any) in the resource location.

In addition to referencing an external XML configuration file, a developer may also specify GemFire System
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/userguide/index.html#reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[properties]
using any of Spring's `Properties` support features.

For example, the developer may use the `properties` element defined in the `util` namespace to define `Properties`
directly or load properties from a properties file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire"
  xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire/spring-gemfire.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/util http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util.xsd">

  <util:properties id="gemfireProperties" location="file:/pivotal/gemfire/gemfire.properties"/>

  <gfe:cache properties-ref="gemfireProperties"/>

</beans>
----

The latter approach is recommended for externalizing environment specific settings outside the application configuration.

NOTE: Cache settings apply only if a new cache needs to be created.  If an open cache already exists in the VM,
these settings are ignored.

[[bootstrap:cache:advanced]]
== Advanced Cache Configuration

For advanced cache configuration, the `cache` element provides a number of configuration options exposed as attributes
or child elements:

[source,xml]
----
<!--1-->
<gfe:cache
    close="false"
    copy-on-read="true"
    critical-heap-percentage="70"
    eviction-heap-percentage="60"
    enable-auto-reconnect="false" <!--2-->
    lock-lease="120"
    lock-timeout="60"
    message-sync-interval="1"
    pdx-serializer-ref="myPdxSerializer"
    pdx-persistent="true"
    pdx-disk-store="diskStore"
    pdx-read-serialized="false"
    pdx-ignore-unread-fields="true"
    search-timeout="300"
    use-cluster-configuration="false" <!--3-->
    lazy-init="true">

  <gfe:transaction-listener ref="myTransactionListener"/> <!--4-->

  <gfe:transaction-writer> <!--5-->
    <bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.example.TransactionListener"/>
  </gfe:transaction-writer>

  <gfe:gateway-conflict-resolver ref="myGatewayConflictResolver"/> <!--6-->

  <gfe:dynamic-region-factory/> <!--7-->

  <gfe:jndi-binding jndi-name="myDataSource" type="ManagedDataSource"/> <!--8-->

</gfe:cache>

----

<1> Various cache options are supported by attributes. For further information regarding anything shown in this example, please consult the GemFire http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/index.html[product documentation].
The `close` attribute determines if the cache should be closed when the Spring application context is closed. The default is `true` however for cases in which multiple application contexts use the cache (common in web applications), set this value to `false`.
The `lazy-init` attribute determines if the cache should be initialized before another bean references it. The default is `true` however in some cases it may be convenient to set this value to `false`.
<2> Setting the `enable-auto-reconnect` attribute to true (default is false), allows a disconnected GemFire member to automatically reconnect and rejoin a GemFire cluster.
See the GemFire http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/latest/managing/autoreconnect/member-reconnect.html[product documentation] for more details.
<3> Setting the `use-cluster-configuration` attribute to true (default is false) to enable a GemFire member to retrieve the common, shared Cluster-based configuration from a Locator.
See the GemFire http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html[product documentation] for more details.
<4> An example of a `TransactionListener` callback declaration using a bean reference. The referenced bean must implement
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/TransactionListener.html[TransactionListener].
`TransactionListener(s)` can be implemented to handle transaction related events.
<5> An example of a `TransactionWriter` callback declaration using an inner bean declaration this time. The bean must implement
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/TransactionWriter.html[TransactionWriter].
`TransactionWriter` is a callback that is allowed to veto a transaction.
<6> An example of a `GatewayConflictResolver` declaration using a bean reference. The referenced bean must implement
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/util/GatewayConflictResolver.html[GatewayConflictResolver].
GatewayConflictResolver is a Cache-level plugin that is called upon to decide what to do with events that originate in other systems and arrive through the WAN Gateway.
<7> Enable GemFire's http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/DynamicRegionFactory.html[DynamicRegionFactory],
which provides a distributed region creation service.
<8> Declares a JNDI binding to enlist an external DataSource in a GemFire transaction.

NOTE: The `use-bean-factory-locator` attribute (not shown) deserves a mention. The factory bean responsible for
creating the cache uses an internal Spring type called a `BeanFactoryLocator` to enable user classes declared in
GemFire's native `cache.xml` to be registered as Spring beans. The `BeanFactoryLocator` implementation also permits
only one bean definition for a cache with a given id. In certain situations, such as running JUnit integration tests
from within Eclipse, it is necessary to disable the `BeanFactoryLocator` by setting this value to false to prevent
an exception. This exception may also arise during JUnit tests running from a build script. In this case the test runner
should be configured to fork a new JVM for each test (in maven, set `<forkmode>always</forkmode>`) . Generally, there is
no harm in setting this value to false.

=== Enabling PDX Serialization

The example above includes a number of attributes related to GemFire's enhanced serialization framework, PDX.
While a complete discussion of PDX is beyond the scope of this reference guide, it is important to note that PDX
is enabled by registering a PDX serializer which is done via the `pdx-serializer` attribute. GemFire provides
an implementation class `com.gemstone.gemfire.pdx.ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer`, however it is common for developers
to provide their own implementation. The value of the attribute is simply a reference to a Spring bean that implements
the required interface. More information on serialization support can be found in <<serialization>>

[[boostrap:cache:auto-reconnect]]
=== Enabling auto-reconnect

Setting the `<gfe:cache enable-auto-reconnect="[true|false*]>` attribute to true should be done with care.

Generally, enabling 'auto-reconnect' should only be done in cases where _Spring Data GemFire's_ XML namespace is used to
configure and bootstrap a new GemFire Server data node to add to the cluster.  In other words, 'auto-reconnect'
should not be used when _Spring Data GemFire_ is used to develop and build an GemFire application that also happens
to be a peer cache member of the GemFire cluster.

The main reason is most GemFire applications use references to the GemFire cache or regions in order to perform
data access operations.  The references are "injected" by the Spring container into application components (e.g. DAOs
or Repositories) for use by the application.  When a member (such as the application) is forcefully disconnected
from the rest of the cluster, presumably because the member (the application) has become unresponsive for
a period of time, or network partition separates one or more members (along with the application peer cache member) into
a group that is too small to act as the distributed system, the member will shutdown and all GemFire component references
(e.g. Cache, Regions, etc) become invalid.

Essentially, the current forced-disconnect processing in each member dismantles the system from the ground up.
It shuts down the JGroups stack, puts the Distributed System in a shut-down state and then closes the Cache.
This effectively loses all in-memory information.

After being disconnected from a distributed system and successfully shutting down, the GemFire member then restarts in a
"reconnecting" state, while periodically attempting to rejoin the distributed system. If the member succeeds in reconnecting,
the member rebuilds its "view" of the distributed system from existing members and receives a new distributed system ID.

This means the cache, regions and other GemFire components are reconstructed and all old references that may have been
injected into application are now stale and no longer valid.

GemFire makes no guarantee, even when using the GemFire public Java API, that application cache, region or other
component references will be automatically refreshed by the reconnect operation. As such, applications must take care
to refresh their own references.

Unfortunately there is no way to be "notified" of a disconnect and subsequently a reconnect event. If so, the application
developer would then have a clean way to know when to call ConfigurableApplicationContext.refresh(), if even applicable
for an application to do so, which is why this "feature" of GemFire 8 is not recommended for peer cache GemFire applications.

For more information about 'auto-reconnect', see GemFire's http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/latest/managing/autoreconnect/member-reconnect.html[product documentation].

[[bootstrap:cache:cluster-configuration]]
=== Using Cluster-based Configuration

GemFire 8's new Cluster-based Configuration Service is a convenient way for a member joining the cluster to get a
"consistent view" of the cluster, by using the shared, persistent configuration maintained by a Locator, ensuring
the member's configuration will be compatible with the GemFire distributed system when the member joins.

This feature of Spring Data GemFire (setting the `use-cluster-configuration` attribute to true) works in the same way
as the `cache-xml-location` attribute, except the source of the GemFire configuration meta-data comes from a network
Locator as opposed to a native `cache.xml` file.

All GemFire native configuration meta-data, whether from `cache.xml` or from the Cluster Configuration Service,
gets applied before any Spring XML configuration meta-data.  As such, Spring's config serves to "augment" the
native GemFire configuration meta-data, which would most likely be specific to the application.

Again, to enable this feature, just specify the following in the Spring XML config:

[source,xml]
----
  <gfe:cache use-cluster-configuration="true"/>
----

NOTE: While certain GemFire tools, like Gfsh, have their actions "recorded" when any schema-like change is made
(e.g. `gfsh>create region --name=Example --type=PARTITION`) to the cluster, Spring Data GemFire's configuration meta-data
specified with the XML namespace is not recorded.  The same is true when using GemFire's public Java API directly;
it too is not recorded.

For more information on GemFire's Cluster Configuration Service, see the
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html[product documentation].

[[bootstrap:cache:server]]
== Configuring a GemFire Cache Server

_Spring Data GemFire_ includes dedicated support for configuring a http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/server/CacheServer.html[CacheServer],
allowing complete configuration through the Spring container:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire/spring-gemfire.xsd
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/context http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <gfe:cache />

  <!-- Advanced example depicting various cache server configuration options -->
  <gfe:cache-server id="advanced-config" auto-startup="true"
       bind-address="localhost" host-name-for-clients="localhost" port="${gemfire.cache.server.port}"
       load-poll-interval="2000" max-connections="22" max-message-count="1000"
       max-threads="16" max-time-between-pings="30000"
       groups="test-server">
    <gfe:subscription-config eviction-type="ENTRY" capacity="1000" disk-store="file://${java.io.tmpdir}"/>
  </gfe:cache-server>

   <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:cache-server.properties"/>

</beans>
----

The configuration above illustrates the `cache-server` element and the many options available.

NOTE: Rather than hard-coding the port, this configuration uses Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#xsd-config-body-schemas-context[context] namespace to declare a `property-placeholder`.
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer[property placeholder]
reads one or more properties files and then replaces property placeholders with values at runtime. This allows administrators
to change values without having to touch the main application configuration.  Spring also provides the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.11.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#new-feature-el[SpEL] and the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.11.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#new-in-3.1-environment-abstraction[environment abstraction]
to support externalization of environment-specific properties from the main codebase, easing deployment across multiple machines.

NOTE: To avoid initialization problems, the `CacheServer` started by _Spring Data GemFire_ will start *after* the container
has been fully initialized.  This allows potential regions, listeners, writers or instantiators defined declaratively
to be fully initialized and registered before the server starts accepting connections.  Keep this in mind when
programmatically configuring these elements as the server might start after your components and thus not be seen
by the clients connecting right away.

[[bootstrap:cache:client]]
== Configuring a GemFire ClientCache

In addition to defining a GemFire peer http://data-docs-samples.cfapps.io/docs-gemfire/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/Cache.html[Cache],
_Spring Data GemFire_ also supports the definition of a GemFire http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/client/ClientCache.html[ClientCache]
in a Spring context.  A `ClientCache` definition is very similar in configuration and use to the GemFire peer <<bootstrap:cache,Cache>>
and is supported by the `org.springframework.data.gemfire.client.ClientCacheFactoryBean`.

The simplest definition of a GemFire cache client with default configuration can be accomplished with the following
declaration:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
    <gfe:client-cache />
</beans>
----

`client-cache` supports much of the same options as the <<bootstrap:cache:advanced,cache>> element.  However, as opposed
to a *full-fledged* cache member, a client cache connects to a remote cache server through a Pool.  By default, a Pool
is created to connect to a server running on `localhost`, listening to port `40404`. The default Pool is used
by all client Regions unless the Region is configured to use a different Pool.

Pools can be defined with the `pool` element.  This client-side Pool can be used to configure connectivity directly to
a server for individual entities or to the entire cache through one or more Locators.

For example, to customize the default Pool used by the `client-cache`, the developer needs to define a Pool and wire it
to the cache definition:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:client-cache id="my-cache" pool-name="my-pool"/>

  <gfe:pool id="my-pool" subscription-enabled="true">
     <gfe:locator host="${gemfire.locator.host}" port="${gemfire.locator.port}"/>
 </gfe:pool>
</beans>
----

The `<client-cache>` element also includes the `ready-for-events` attribute.  If set to `true`, the client cache
initialization will include a call to http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/client/ClientCache.html#readyForEvents()[ClientCache.readyForEvents()].

Client-side configuration is covered in more detail in <<bootstrap:region:client>>.

[[bootstrap:cache:client:pool]]
=== GemFire's DEFAULT Pool and Spring Data GemFire Pool Definitions

If a GemFire `ClientCache` is local-only, then no Pool definition is required.  For instance, a developer may define:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache/>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" shortcut="LOCAL"/>
----

In this case, the "Example" Region is `LOCAL` and no data is distributed between the client and a server, therefore,
no Pool is necessary.  This is true for any client-side, local-only Region, as defined by the GemFire's
http://data-docs-samples.cfapps.io/docs-gemfire/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/client/ClientRegionShortcut.html[ClientRegionShortcut]
(all `LOCAL_*` shortcuts).

However, if the client Region is a (caching) proxy to a server-side Region, then a Pool is required.  There are several
ways to define and use a Pool in this case.

When a client cache, Pool and proxy-based Region are all defined, but not explicitly identified, _Spring Data GemFire_
will resolve the references automatically for you.

For example:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache/>

<gfe:pool>
  <gfe:locator host="${gemfire.locator.host}" port="${gemfire.locator.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" shortcut="PROXY"/>
----

In this case, the client cache is identified as `gemfireCache`, the Pool as `gemfirePool` and the client Region as,
well, "Example".  However, the client cache will initialize GemFire's DEFAULT Pool from the `gemfirePool`
and the client Region will use the `gemfirePool` when distributing data between the client and the server.

_Spring Data GemFire_ basically resolves the above configuration to the following:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache id="gemfireCache" pool-name="gemfirePool"/>

<gfe:pool id="gemfirePool">
  <gfe:locator host="${gemfire.locator.host}" port="${gemfire.locator.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" cache-ref="gemfireCache" pool-name="gemfirePool" shortcut="PROXY"/>
----

GemFire still creates a Pool called "DEFAULT".  _Spring Data GemFire_ will just cause the "DEFAULT" Pool to be
initialized from `gemfirePool`.  This is useful in situations where multiple Pools are defined and client Regions
are using separate Pools.

Consider the following:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache pool-name="locatorPool"/>

<gfe:pool id="locatorPool">
  <gfe:locator host="${gemfire.locator.host}" port="${gemfire.locator.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:pool id="serverPool">
  <gfe:locator host="${gemfire.server.host}" port="${gemfire.server.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" pool-name="serverPool" shortcut="PROXY"/>

<gfe:client-region id="AnotherExample" shortcut="CACHING_PROXY"/>

<gfe:client-region id="YetAnotherExample" shortcut="LOCAL"/>
----

In this setup, the GemFire client cache's "DEFAULT" Pool is initialized from "locatorPool" as specified with the
`pool-name` attribute.  There is no _Spring Data GemFire_-defined `gemfirePool` since both Pools were explicitly
identified (named) "locatorPool" and "serverPool", respectively.

The "Example" Region explicitly refers to and uses the "serverPool" exclusively.  The "AnotherExample" Region uses
GemFire's "DEFAULT" Pool, which was configured from the "locatorPool" based on the client cache bean definition's
`pool-name` attribute.

Finally, the "YetAnotherExample" Region will not use a Pool since it is `LOCAL`.

NOTE: The "AnotherExample" Region would first look for a Pool bean named `gemfirePool`, but that would require
the definition of an anonymous Pool bean (i.e. `<gfe:pool/>`) or a Pool bean explicitly named `gemfirePool`
(e.g. `<gfe:pool id="gemfirePool"/>`).

NOTE: We could have either named "locatorPool", "gemfirePool", or made the Pool bean definition anonymous
and it would have the same effect as the above configuration.
