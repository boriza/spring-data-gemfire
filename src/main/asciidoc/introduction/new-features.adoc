= New Features

NOTE: As of the 1.2.0 release, this project, formerly known as Spring GemFire, has been renamed to Spring Data GemFire
to reflect that it is now a component of the http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data] project.

[[new-in-1-2-0]]
== New in the 1.2 Release

* Full support for GemFire configuration via the SDG *gfe* namespace. Now GemFire components may be configured completely without requiring a native *cache.xml* file.
* WAN Gateway support for GemFire 6.6.x. See <<bootstrap:gateway>>.
* Spring Data Repository support using a dedicated SDG namespace, *gfe-data*. See <<gemfire-repositories>>
* Namespace support for registering GemFire Functions. See <<bootstrap:function>>
* A top-level `<disk-store>` element has been added to the SDG *gfe* namespace to allow sharing of persist stores among Regions,
and other components that support persistent backup or overflow. See <<bootstrap-diskstore>>
+
WARNING: The `<*-region>` elements no longer allow a nested `<disk-store>` element.
+
* GemFire Sub-Regions are supported via nested `<*-region>` elements.
* A `<local-region>` element has been added to configure a Local Region.
* Support for the re-designed WAN Gateway in GemFire 7.0.

== New in the 1.3 Release

* Annotation support for GemFire Functions. It is now possible to declare and register Functions written as POJOs using annotations. In addition, Function executions are defined as
annotated interfaces, similar to the way Spring Data Repositories work. See <<function-annotations>>.
* Added a `<datasource>` element to the SDG *gfe-data* namespace to simplify establishing a basic <<data-access:datasource,client connection>> to a GemFire data grid.
* Added a `<json-region-autoproxy>` element to the SDG *gfe-data* namespace to <<bootstrap:region:json,support JSON>> features introduced
in GemFire 7.0, enabling Spring AOP to perform the necessary conversions automatically on Region operations.
* Upgraded to GemFire 7.0.1 and added namespace support for new AsyncEventQueue attributes.
* Added support for setting subscription interest policy on Regions.
* Support for void returns on Function executions.  See <<function-annotations>> for complete details.
* Support for persisting Local Regions. See <<bootstrap:region:local>> and <<bootstrap:region:common:attributes>>.
* Support for entry time-to-live and entry idle-time on a GemFire Client Cache. See <<bootstrap:cache:client>>.
* Support for multiple Spring Data GemFire web-based applications using a single GemFire cluster, operating concurrently inside tc Server.
* Support for concurrency-checks-enabled on all GemFire Cache Region definitions using the SDG *gfe* namespace. See <<bootstrap:region:common:attributes>>.
* Support for Cache Loaders and Cache Writers on Client, Local Regions. See <<bootstrap:region:common:loaders-writers>>.
* Support for registering CacheListeners, AsyncEventQueues and Gateway Senders on GemFire Cache Sub-Regions.
* Support for PDX persistent keys in GemFire Regions.
* Support for correct Partition Region bean creation in a Spring context when collocation is specified with the *colocated-with* attribute.
* Full support for GemFire Cache Sub-Regions using proper, nested `<*-region>` element syntax in the SDG *gfe* namespace.
* Upgraded Spring Data GemFire to Spring Framework 3.2.8.
* Upgraded Spring Data GemFire to Spring Data Commons 1.7.1.

* Upgrades Spring Data GemFire to Spring Data Commons 1.8.0.
* Upgrades Spring Data GemFire to Spring Framework 3.2.9.

along with a Spring Boot sample application demonstrating GemFire Cache Transactions configured with SDG
and bootstrapped with Spring Boot.
* Support for bootstrapping a Spring Context in a GemFire Server when started from Gfsh.
See <<gemfire-bootstrap>> for more details.
* Support for persisting application domain object/entities to multiple GemFire Cache Regions.
See <<mapping.entities>> for more details.
* Support for persisting application domain object/entities to GemFire Cache Sub-Regions, avoiding collisions
when Sub-Regions are uniquely identifiable, but identically named.
See <<mapping.entities>> for more details.
* Adds strict XSD type rules to, and full support for, Data Policies and Region Shortcuts on all GemFire
Cache Region types.
* Changed the default behavior of SDG `<*-region>` elements from lookup to always create a new Region
along with an option to restore old behavior using the *ignore-if-exists* attribute.
See <<bootstrap:region:common:attributes,Common Region Attributes>> and <<bootstrap:region:common:regions-subregions-lookups-caution>>
for more details.
* Enables Spring Data GemFire to be fully built and ran on JDK 7 and JDK 8 (Note, however, GemFire has not yet
been fully tested and supported on JDK 8;
See http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/docs-gemfire/supported_configs/supported_configs_and_system_reqs.html[GemFire User Guide]
